# AE353 (Spring, 2021)

This repository supports the course **AE353: Aerospace Control Systems** that was taught by [Prof. Timothy Bretl](https://aerospace.illinois.edu/directory/profile/tbretl) in Spring 2021 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It contains the code to generate the [course website](https://tbretl.github.io/ae353-sp21/) as well as other course materials.

We do a lot of simulation in this class and make frequent use of the [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org) simulator. We gratefully acknowledge the example code provide by [Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti) in his own course ["ROB2004: Robotics manipulation and Locomotion" at NYU](https://github.com/righetti/ROB2004).
