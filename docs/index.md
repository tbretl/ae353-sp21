## Course Description

Modeling, analysis, and control of linear dynamic systems.

## Prerequisite

Be an undergraduate student in Aerospace Engineering, with credit or concurrent registration in MATH 225, MATH 285, and TAM 212 (or equivalent). You cannot take this class if you have already taken GE 320 or ME 340.

## Reference Text

The following book is available online for free, as a reference:
* [Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers (Astrom and Murray)](https://fbswiki.org/)

There is no required textbook.

## Grading

You will be asked to do four things in this class:
* Respond to a short survey either during or within 24 hours of each lecture
* Participate in our discussion form (i.e., ask and answer questions)
* Complete a set of low-stakes, auto-graded homework problems
* Complete four control design projects and collect the results (paper, code, video) in a portfolio

You are guaranteed a B if you do all of the following things:
* Submit a response to 90% of the surveys
* Accumulate at least 400 reputation points on Campuswire
* Submit correct answers to at least 90% of the homework problems
* Submit all four control design projects (1) on time - no more than 5 total days late, (2) with a substantive difference between initial drafts and the final version, and (3) with evidence of having found and explored something that interests you

During the semester, you will receive only three possible grades on your control design projects:
* Not satisfactory for B
* Satisfactory for B
* Better than B

We will not distinguish between grades higher than B until we look at your entire portfolio at the end of the semester.
